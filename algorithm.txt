step1- created a directory stage1-review.

step2- created files (day4.sh,x.java,y.py,z.js) inside stage1-review directory.

step3- uses nano day4.sh to do editing/modification for given condition

step4- inside day4.sh scripting file uses for loop for given condition
        (nano day4.sh)

step5- using for loop to read each file and to display files with x.java,y.py,z.js
        (for files in `ls *.java` ls *.py` ls *.js`)

step6- using for loop and awk to display file 




          for files in `ls *.java` `ls *.py` `ls *.js`
do
  folderName=`echo $files | awk -F. '{print $1}'`
  folderName2=`echo $files | awk -F. '{print $2}'`
      mkdir -p $folderName/$folderName2
      mv $files $folderName/$folderName2
done




        - starting the loop with do
        - using awk to read the file name into folderName
        - making directory with the filename
        - moving the file into folder using $folderName
        - indicating done to close for loop
