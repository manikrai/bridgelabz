step1-takes the input from user 
      
      to take input I uses the keyword read -p
step2-
      after that uses for loop
   
     ( for ch in {a..z} )
     ch stands for characters and {a..z} characters from a to z
step3-
          uses a variable (var)
           ( var=${text//[^$ch]/} )
         $text will store the input string i.e enterd by user

step4-
       to get the output uses thes keyword 
         echo " ${ch} presents ${#var} times"
