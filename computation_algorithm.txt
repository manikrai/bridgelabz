step1-
      write program to take three inputs
    read -p "Enter your value: " number1
I uses this method to take input from user 

step2-
       performed various operations such as (a+b*c) (a*b+c) (c+a/b) (a%b+c)

to perform these operations created a variable name operation1,operation2,operation3,operation4 to store the result in these
variables
         operation1=$(($number1+$number2*$number3))

step3-after storing all the results in these variables
           created a Dictionary
           using key-word (declare -A computation)

step4-
          store the result of these operations in Dictionary
   
        computation[comp1]=$operation1
       -will follow the same process to store all the results

step5-
       sort the array in bash
     
             -using bubble sort
 
      echo "Array in original order"
    echo ${array[*]} 

step6-
 uses for loop for programming of array in ascending order
  
  for ((i = 0; i<4; i++))
   do
     for ((j = 0; j<4-i-1; j++))
      do
 
step7-
                now inside for loop I uses conditional statement


step8- follow the same step as step6 to achieve the order
